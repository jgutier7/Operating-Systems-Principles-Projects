# Operating-Systems-Principles-Projects
Project for my Operating Systems Principles Course

Project 1: Process Queue Shell
The first project is to build a basic shell that serves as a multi-core process queue called pqsh. This program allows the user to enter in a series of commands and then schedules the specified jobs to run on multiple CPU cores as separate processes.

Project 02: Message Queue
The second project is to build a message queue client that interacts with a rudimentary pub/sub system using POSIX threads and network sockets via a RESTful API. In a pub/sub system there is usually one server and multiple clients:

Project 3: Heap Management
The third project is to build your own implementation of malloc and free. That is, you will need to implement a library that interacts with the operating system to perform heap management on behalf of a user process as demonstrated in class.

Project 4: 
The last project is to build a simplified version of the Unix File System called SimpleFS, compsoed of a Shell, File System, and a Disk Emulator
